RegExcellent Quest by Team RegExcellent 

# Description
RegExcellent Quest is a learning tool built to help programmers learn regular expressions in game format. Traverse different levels but watch out for traps! If you run into one, you'll need the right item to dismantle the trap. In order to acquire the items you need, you'll need to write a regular expression that matches the name of that item. Traps will get harder over time and you'll need to ensure your regular expression does not match any hazardous items that won't help you.

For example: You come across a deadly pile of leaves. You will need a RAKE to move them but you do not want a SNAKE.
